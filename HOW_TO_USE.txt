How Beacon Works:
Beacon will automatically advertise your active tcp/ip games to all other users.
You can find these game listings either in the program itself or in our discord chat: https://discord.com/channels/897073630868013057/1290658893747322880
The only information stored by the program are the values you see displayed on the screen.
All entries are volatile and remove themselves upon closing the program or game.
